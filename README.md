I finish this project under Scrimba(https://scrimba.com/playlist/pZZxqsB)

It is a mobile app that can be applied to both Android and iPhone. It can be used as a memo, for example, you can use it to remember your shopping list before going to the mall. Write down the item and then click the "Add to cart" button, the item will be shown below. All the items will be displayed in order. When click one of the items, it will disappear, which means you have bought it. 

It is a comprehensive and functional project which contains HTML, css and javascript. I learned a lot from it. I learned to import external functions into a js file and how to design a user-friendly website. More importantly, this is the first time I learned how to use Firebase to store, import and export  data. In this project, I mainly used the initializeApp, getDatabase, ref and onValue funcitons to deal with the database.
